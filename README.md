This repository contains some code I've written as a hobby, such as implementing data structures, pseudorandom number generators and a procedural noise generation algorithm called Perlin Noise. There's also a simple game "Shark Lunch" written using PyGame, which I created as a project during a Python programming course in the first semester of my bachelor studies.
